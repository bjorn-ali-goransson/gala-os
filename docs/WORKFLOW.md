# Working on gala-os (handbook for agents and humans)

The fastest way to get productive in a new session. Read `CLAUDE.md`, then
this, then the parts of `ARCHITECTURE.md` you touch. `ROADMAP.md` says what
is done and what comes next (the "Next" list is the agreed order).

## One chunk of work

1. **Test first.** Create `user/<feature>_test/` (copy `Cargo.toml` from
   another test with `sed 's/file_test/<feature>_test/g'`). Its `main`
   returns 0 or the number of the failing check and prints
   `<feature>_test: ok`. Expected values are what real Windows (pinned
   build) returns; say in the doc comment what is assumed.
2. Wire it up:
   - `xtask/src/main.rs`: add to `USER_PROGRAMS`, add a `Scenario`
     (`cmdline: "qemu_exit run=<feature>_test.exe [args=...]"`), and, if it
     needs the test ntdll or DLLs, `EXTRA_MODULES` entries
     (`("x_test", "ntdll.dll", "Windows/System32")`).
   - Root `Cargo.toml` workspace members.
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: append `-p <feature>_test` to the
     Windows-target clippy line; test DLLs go on the DLL build/clippy lines.
   - `user/bin/run-all.ps1` only if the program needs arguments on Windows.
3. `cargo xtask boot-test <feature>_test`: see it fail for the right reason.
4. Implement. Host unit tests for pure logic (`#[cfg(test)]` in the module).
5. Checks (all must pass):
   ```sh
   cargo fmt --all
   sed -n 20,25p .github/workflows/ci.yml | sed 's/^ *//' | bash -e   # clippy
   cargo xtask test            # host tests + every boot scenario
   cargo xtask export-tests    # refresh user/bin (CI compares)
   ```
6. Update `docs/ROADMAP.md` (move the item to done, with the test name) and
   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how it works, invariants, TODOs). Commit with a
   message saying what the test checks and what changed; push.

## Things that are easy to get wrong

- **System call numbers.** Long-stable x64 numbers are used directly (list
  in `kernel/src/nt/syscalls.rs`). Numbers that change between builds are
  *gala's own choices*, unverified: tests must call those services through
  ntdll exports (`find_ntdll()` + `find_export()` in ntrt), and
  `user/testntdll` provides stubs with gala's numbers (`syscall_stubs!`).
  On Windows the same test then uses the real ntdll.
- **testntdll is gala's stand-in ntdll**, shipped only in scenarios that
  list it in `EXTRA_MODULES`. It contains a small loader (LdrLoadDll etc.),
  exception/APC dispatchers and the stubs. Adding an export there changes
  `user/bin/testntdll.dll`.
- **Fallible allocation only** (`try_box`, `try_push`, `try_reserve`);
  clippy bans the rest. `unsafe` only where `CLAUDE.md` allows it.
- **Multiprocessor.** Since S1 the APs are online. Never rely on "interrupts
  off" as a lock; use `sync::IrqMutex`. Per-CPU data lives behind GS
  (`arch::percpu`).
- **Commit messages** are passed through the shell: do not put backticks in
  a double-quoted `-m` (use a heredoc `-F -`).
- **Flaky boot tests** usually mean a race; rerun the one scenario a few
  times (`cargo xtask boot-test name`) before blaming CI.

## Debugging

- `XTASK_VERBOSE=1 cargo xtask boot-test name` prints the serial log; logs
  are also kept in `target/debug/test-<name>.serial.log`.
- Kernel command-line flag `trace` logs every system call with arguments
  and status (add it to a scenario's `cmdline` temporarily).
- `cargo xtask report` writes `target/report/gala.{json,md}`;
  `cargo xtask compare windows.json` diffs against results collected on
  Windows with `user/bin/run-all.ps1`.
- See `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for the planned profiling and telemetry.
